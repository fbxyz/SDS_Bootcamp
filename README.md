# Leveraging Python for Spatial Data Science

## [Spatial Data Science Bootcamp Paris](https://spatial-data-science-conference.com/bootcamps/2023/) October 26th, 2023

[Florian Bayer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-bayer-a4117b30/), PhD in Public Health, MSc in Geography

Health geographer at Agence de la biomédecine, University lecturer at Paris Panthéon Sorbonne and ENSG

## Objective
The objective of this workshop is to provide an overview of spatial analysis tools that enable leveraging spatial dimension in your analyses.

The data comes from the [french health ministry.](https://annuaire.sante.fr/web/site-pro/extractions-publiques)

We will focus on the issue of the spatial distribution of self-employed general practitioners (not employed by a healthcare institution) in Paris and its outskirts. 

The goal is to determine whether there are spatial disparities in the distribution of general practitioners related to the population.

## Workshop Outline:

- Data management
- Introduction to the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP)
- Frontier effect
- Hot Spot Detection and spatial autocorrelation
